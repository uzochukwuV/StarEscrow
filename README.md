StarEscrow is a programmable escrow protocol for freelance and marketplace payments on the Stellar network, built with Soroban smart contracts. It locks funds on-chain when a job is created, optionally routes them through a yield protocol while work is in progress, and releases payment to the freelancer upon payer approval — or refunds the payer on cancellation or deadline expiry. A configurable fee (in basis points) is deducted from the released amount and forwarded to a fee collector address.

### State Machine

```mermaid

    Active --> WorkSubmitted : submit_work()\n[freelancer]
    Active --> Cancelled : cancel()\n[payer, before submission]
    Active --> Expired : expire()\n[payer, after deadline]

    WorkSubmitted --> Completed : approve()\n[payer]

    Completed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
    Expired --> [*]

    note right of Active
        Funds locked in contract.
        Yield accruing (if enabled).
    end note

    note right of Completed
        Funds (minus fee) released
        to freelancer.
    end note

    note right of Cancelled
        Full refund + yield
        returned to payer.
    end note

    note right of Expired
        Full refund + yield
        returned to payer after
        deadline has passed.
    end note

- [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — Build, deploy to testnet and mainnet, post-deployment checks
- [Security & Threat Model](docs/SECURITY.md) — Trusted parties, attack vectors, mitigations, and out-of-scope threats
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) — Version history and notable changes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli) (`stellar`)

### CLI Installation

The StarEscrow CLI (`star-escrow`) provides a convenient interface for interacting with the escrow contract.

#### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henry-peters/StarEscrow.git
   cd StarEscrow
   ```

2. Build the CLI in release mode:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release -p cli
   ```

3. The binary will be located at:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/star-escrow
   ```

4. (Optional) Install it to your PATH:

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   cp ./target/release/star-escrow /usr/local/bin/

   # Or using cargo install (if you have cargo-install)
   cargo install --path clients/cli
   ```

#### Prerequisites for CLI

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli) (for contract interactions)

#### Verify Installation

After building, verify the CLI is working:

```bash
./target/release/star-escrow --help
```

You should see usage information for all available commands.

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Test

```bash
make test
```

### Lint & Format

```bash
make lint
make fmt
```

A `Makefile` is provided with targets: `build`, `test`, `lint`, `fmt`, `clean`.

### Deploy

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full instructions.

## Usage

Set required environment variables:

```bash
export ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID=<contract-id>
export ADMIN_SECRET=<admin-secret-key>
export PAYER_SECRET=<payer-secret-key>
export FREELANCER_SECRET=<freelancer-secret-key>
```

Initialize the protocol (admin, one-time):

```bash
star-escrow init \
  --fee-bps 100 \
  --fee-collector <fee-collector-address>
```

Create an escrow and lock funds:

```bash
star-escrow create \
  --freelancer <freelancer-address> \
  --token <token-address> \
  --amount 1000000000 \
  --milestone "Deliver final design assets" \
  --deadline 1800000000
```

Freelancer submits work, payer approves:

```bash
star-escrow submit-work
star-escrow approve
```

Cancel before work is submitted (payer only):

```bash
star-escrow cancel
```

Run `star-escrow --help` for the full command reference.

## Event Indexing

StarEscrow is optimized for event-driven frontends. We recommend using **Mercury** for indexing.

1. **Schema:** Detailed event structures are located in [docs/INDEXING.md](./docs/INDEXING.md).
2. **Setup:** Ensure your indexer filters by the `StarEscrow` Contract ID.
3. **Webhooks:** You can configure Mercury to send POST requests to your backend whenever `milestone_submitted` is emitted to automate notifications.

---

### Completion of Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **Event Schema Documented:** Included in Section 1, mapping the Rust `pub fn` events to their XDR topics and data.
2.  **Integration Guide:** Section 2 provides the "Mercury" setup steps.
3.  **Example Queries:** Section 3 provides GraphQL templates for common dashboard needs (Earnings and Live Feeds).
4.  **README Section:** Section 4 provides the exact text to paste into your root `README.md`.

**Would you like me to generate a specific Rust "Event Watcher" script using the `stellar-rpc-client` to demonstrate how to poll these events locally?**
